	<p class="blocktext">The definition of join is very interesting and has several meanings which we love because we believe it captures the essence of what we are creating here at Fonville Living. Merriam-Webster's has one meaning that speaks about who we are. The dictionary defines join as; <font color="BA4A00"><strong>To put or bring together so as to form a unit. This explains who and what we are.</strong></font></p>
	<p class="blocktext">Our enrollment opens up every 3 months.  If you are serious about learning to eat and cook well you are definitely invited to fill out our application. We give cooking lessons and all of the groceries will be provided.  We also provide food vouchers so that you can continue doing what is taught in the classes and Transportation will be provided for those who need it.</p>
